A Futile Attempt at Making Money. But also because I enjoy coding.

## Only useful_funcs.py and the APIs folder are working. The rest is there in case I need to reference anything from previous attempts.

This code will gather data related to stock prices, including historical price data, reddit posts, analyst ratings, and more.
It will use this data to try and predict future price changes. It follows a few steps to do so.

1. Collecting data
2. Processing data (predicting)
3. Updating model

TODO: Go into detail about each step
